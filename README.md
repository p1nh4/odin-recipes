# odin-recipes

The aim to create a recipe page. 

This project is part of The Odin Project (Foundations)

I practised ordered and unordered lists, as well as linking to other pages and putting images on the respective pages. I also practised organising my project in the best way possible and documenting it with comments, as well as making commits to upload my project and describing them in an organised way, and finally deploying the project via Github.
