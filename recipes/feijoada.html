    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</li>
        <li>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion.</li>
        <li>Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Drain and add to beans. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</li>
