    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic prawns are a traditional dish from Spanish cuisine, especially popular as a tapa. It consists of prawns (or shrimp) cooked in olive oil with sliced garlic, dried chili for a spicy kick, and often garnished with fresh parsley. They are served hot, accompanied by bread to enjoy the flavorful garlic-infused oil. It's a simple yet flavorful dish.</p>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
        <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece of butter, and 1/2 of the parsley; cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if too thick, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste; serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley. Enjoy!</li>
