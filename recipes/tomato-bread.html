    <p>Bread with tomato, known as **"pa amb tomàquet"** in Catalonia, is a traditional dish from Spanish cuisine, simple and delicious. It consists of slices of toasted bread rubbed with garlic and ripe tomato, seasoned with olive oil and a pinch of salt. It can be served on its own or paired with cured meats, cheeses, or ham. It’s a light, healthy, and highly appreciated option as a starter or snack.</p>
